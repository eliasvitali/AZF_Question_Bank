Troubleshooting Tips:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
If questions are missing:
1. Check the PDF for special formatting (tables, images, etc.)
2. Look for page breaks in the middle of questions
3. Verify the question has exactly 4 answers (A, B, C, D)
4. Check if footer text is interfering with parsing
5. Manually add missing questions to questions.json if needed
